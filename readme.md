# rick

*The Spotify CLI that's never going to give you up, and never going to let you down*

## about
`rick` provides a command line interface for controlling Spotify without having to open the window.

## build from source
Requires at least Go 1.16

In order to build from source, clone down the repository and run `go install` from the root directory.
Make sure the install directory is on the path in order to call directly from the command line.

## TODO
* handle config files with viper?
